    <p>><strong><u>(Paragraph command is used here!)</u></strong>English is
      a West Germanic language that originated from Anglo-Frisian dialects
      brought to Britain in the mid 5th to 7th centuries AD by Anglo-Saxon
      settlers. With the end of Roman rule in 410 AD, Latin ceased to be a
       major influence on the Celtic languages spoken by the majority of t
       he population.[citation needed] People from what is now northwest G
       ermany, west Denmark and the Netherlands settled in the British Isl
       es from the mid-5th century and came to culturally dominate the bul
       k of southern Great Britain until the 7th century. The Anglo-Saxon l
       anguage, now called Old English, originated as a group of Anglo-Fris
       ian dialects which were spoken, at least by the settlers, in England
        and southern and eastern Scotland in the early Middle Ages.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;">><strong><u>(Paragraph command is used here!)
        </u></strong><p><img src="domenico.jpg" width="50%"></p>It displaced to some
        extent the Celtic languages that predominated previously. Old English
        also reflected the varied origins of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms establi
        shed in different parts of Britain. The Late West Saxon dialect eventu
        ally became dominant. A significant subsequent influence on the shaping
         of Old English came from contact with the North Germanic languages spo
         ken by the Scandinavian Vikings who conquered and colonized parts of B
         ritain during the 8th and 9th centuries, which led to much lexical bor
         rowing and grammatical simplification. The Anglian dialects had a grea
         ter influence on Middle English.</p>
